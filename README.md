# Paul Dill React Portfolio_2.0
***
## General Info
This project will serve as a personal portfolio for showcasing my software engineering projects.  My current portfolio is built using Next.js, and it leaves a lot to be desired.  Rather than refactoring that app, I've chosen to start a new one using a single page React app because I don't need the multipage features of Next.js.  This app is being built using TypeScript, and I will be creating a Node.js backend for certain features like the contact form.  I've only used JavaScript so far, so learning TypeScript will be a valuable skill to develop.
